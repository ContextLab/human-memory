\section*{Graded questions}
In answering the questions below, consider this week's material in the
context of the other material we've learned throughout the course.

\begin{enumerate}
\item How do our brains organize and spontaneously retrieve memories?
  Use an example if it helps, or you can give a general answer.
  \textbf{(2-3 paragraphs)}

\item In your view, what is the single greatest challenge to our understanding
  of human memory?  For example, where is our knowledge of ``how
  memory works'' weakest?  Or, what sorts of questions about memory are
  the most difficult to study?  Why?  \textbf{(2-3 paragraphs)}

\item What would need to happen in order to overcome (solve) the challenge(s) you
  identified above?  Do you think it's possible and/or will ever be
  possible to address that challenge or are we doomed to always have
  an incomplete understanding of memory?  Why?  \textbf{(2-3 paragraphs)}
\end{enumerate}
